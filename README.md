# csc-791-realtime-ai-final-project

Structure of Repository:

* Project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook to Run All Experiments
* Report.pdf: Report that describes results
* Final_LPRNet_model.pth: Pre-trained LPR model
* test_data.zip: Test data used to evaluate performance

How to Run Project:

1. Upload notebook, pretrained model and zip file to Google Colab (make sure to set CPU as runtime environment).
2. Run through code cell by cell (will take some time to run) everything.
3. Relevant statistics, including inference speed, model size, and model accuracy, are reported in the outputs of cells titled **Results of**.
