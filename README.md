# csc-791-realtime-ai-final-project

Structure of Repository:

* `Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook to Run All Experiments
* `Report.pdf`: Report that describes results
* `Final_LPRNet_model.pth`: Pre-trained LPR model
* `test_data.zip`: Test data used to evaluate performance
* `README.md`: This file.

How to Run Project:

1. Upload Jupyter notebook, pre-trained LPR model, and test data zip file to Google Colab (make sure to set CPU as runtime environment).
2. Run through code cell-by-cell (will take some time to run everything) up until the **Conclusions** section.
3. Relevant statistics, including inference speed, model size, and model accuracy, are reported in the outputs of cells titled **Results of**.
